# ICWA-caselaw
The United States government has a long and sordid history of separating children from their parents in this country.  In the mid-1800s public and private agencies were routinely removing minor tribal citizens (hereafter “MTCs”)  from their homes with the Federal Government’s consent. About 100 years later, a Congressional investigation revealed that between 25-35% of MTCs in the US were taken from families by state welfare agencies and that a gross disproportionality existed whereby MTCs were 7-8 times more likely to be removed compared to white children with the vast majority placed in non—Tribal homes with white parents. 
Much of the disproportionality had to do with the biases and prejudice of multiple systems of oppression working in conjunction to remove children out of ignorance of tribal customs and out of a failure to recognize the cultural and social standards prevailing in indigenous communities.

In response to the wholesale removal of children from indigenous households, the US government enacted the "Indian Child Welfare Act" (ICWA) in 1978. The ICWA (25 U.S.C. §1902) which was enacted by congress in accordance with its authority under the Indian commerce clause, has been described as a "monumental piece of legislation" that affects every Native American child born in the united states (Fletcher, 2007). This past year myself and two students wanted to better understand the context of the ICWA from a spatial epidemiological perspective. We first undertook an analysis of ICWA caselaw to better understand why, despite this legislation, Native American children continue to be disproportionately represented in the foster care system 50 year after its enactment. Our main interest was to better understand the reasons for why families are being dissolved for the purpose of creating sensitive and effective interventions. 

Here, we describe the first step of our analysis, namely to identify and download a corpus of ICWA caselaw. Thereafter, it is possible to analyze the caselaw (i.e. the text) using more advanced textual analysis and data science tools.

The Harvard Law School provides a way to access ICWA caselaw data fairly easily. The Harvard Law School's Caselaw Access Project can be accessed here https://case.law. The R script will download all available ICWA cases into an R data frame object for further analysis.
